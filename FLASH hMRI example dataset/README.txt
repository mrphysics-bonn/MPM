This folder contains sample data for multi-parameter mapping (MPM).

Sample dataset
==============

This dataset is the FLASH MPM scan with 2 mm isotropic resolution for a single subject at 3T.

- RF receive sensitivity maps of head coil and body coil are acquired with Siemens sequences, stored in RF_sens_head and RF_sens_body folders. 
- B1 transmit correction uses B1 maps acquired with a 3DREAM sequence. Raw images/B1/B0 maps are stored in ThreeDream/ThreeDreamB1/ThreeDreamB0 folders.
- MTw/PDw/T1w images are acquired with FLASH at 1mm isotropic resolution and downsampled to 2 mm isotropic resolution.
