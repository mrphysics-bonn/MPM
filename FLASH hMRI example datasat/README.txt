This folder contains sample data for multi-parameter mapping (MPM).

Sample dataset
==============

This dataset is the FLASH scan with 2 mm isotropic resolution for a single subject at 3T.

- RF receive sensitivity maps of head coil and body coil are acquired with Siemens sequences, stored in RF_sens_head and RF_sens_body folders. 
- B1 transmit bias correction uses pre-processed B1 map acquired with 3DREAM sequences, which are stored in ThreeDream/ThreeDreamB1/ThreeDreamB0 folders.
- MTw/PDw/T1w images are acquired with FLASH at 2 mm isotropic resolution.
